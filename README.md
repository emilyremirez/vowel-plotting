# vowel-plotting

This notebook is intended to help beginning phonetics students produce plots of their own vowels. It was originally created for Ling 110, Phonetics, at UC Berkeley. If you are neither a beginning phonetics student nor a teacher of beginning phonetics students, you may still find the function defined within the notebook useful for a quick way to produce vowel plots.

This demo was added to Ling Methods Hub here: https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/python/vowel-plotting-py/

[index.ipynb](https://github.com/emilyremirez/vowel-plotting/blob/main/index.ipynb) walks through the steps of making a vowel plot, including subsetting data and psychoacoustic normalizing. The repository also includes a couple of vowel datasets.
